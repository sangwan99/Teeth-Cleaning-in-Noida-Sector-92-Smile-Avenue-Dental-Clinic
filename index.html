                    <p class=" mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">Regular teeth cleaning is essential for preventing gum disease, cavities, and bad breath. Even with diligent brushing and flossing at home, plaque and tartar can build up in hard-to-reach areas. This buildup can lead to various dental issues if not professionally removed. A professional tooth cleaning not only removes this buildup but also polishes your teeth, making them look brighter and feel smoother.</p>

                <p class=" mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">Understanding the <a class="text-cyan-500 underline" href="https://smiledentalavenue.com/teeth-whitening-in-noida/">teeth cleaning</a> procedure can help alleviate any anxiety you might have about visiting the dentist. Here’s a step-by-step guide to what you can expect during your appointment at Smile Avenue Dental Clinic:</p>

                    <p class="font-bold text-3xl leading-relaxed text-black mb-4">Initial Examination</p>
                    <p class=" mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">The procedure starts with an initial examination. The dentist or dental hygienist will use a small mirror to inspect your mouth for any signs of gum disease or other potential concerns. If any significant issues are detected, further investigation or treatment may be recommended before proceeding with the cleaning.</p>

                </div>
                <p class=" mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">Using a scaler, the dental professional will remove plaque and tartar around your gum line and between your teeth. The scraping sound may be disconcerting, but it is a normal part of the process. The more tartar you have, the more time it will take to remove it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="flex flex-col mt-10">

                </div>
                <p class=" mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">Once your teeth are free of tartar, they will be cleaned with a high-powered electric brush and gritty toothpaste. This deep cleaning helps remove any remaining plaque and tartar, as well as surface stains. You’ll notice a polished, smooth feeling on your teeth afterward.

                <p class=" mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">Regardless of how well you floss at home, nothing beats a professional flossing session. The dental professional will expertly floss your teeth, removing any remaining debris between your teeth and ensuring your gums are healthy.</p>

                </div>
                <p class=" mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">The final step in the cleaning process is a fluoride treatment. This treatment helps protect your teeth against cavities for several months. The fluoride is applied in the form of a gel, foam, or varnish and is left on the teeth for a few minutes to allow it to absorb fully.</p>
